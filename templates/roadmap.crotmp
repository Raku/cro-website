      <h1>Roadmap</h1>
      <p>
        This page provides a rough guide to our plans for Cro through to a 1.0
        release. It will be refined in response to user feedback.
      </p>

      <div class="card">
        <div class="card-header">
          Cro 0.9
        </div>
        <div class="card-body">
          <p>Provide support for some further use cases, and work towards
            making both Cro and the services written in it more
            dependable.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Provide a module to aid writing tests of HTTP services and
              web socket applications.
              (<strong>ðŸ”§ DONE
                  FOR HTTP</strong> in 0.7.5)</li>
            <li>Provide implementations of timeout, retry, circuit breaker,
              and other common robustness patterns.</li>
            <li>Implement HTTP reverse proxy support.</li>
            <li>Ensure Cro features are fully working on Windows and OSX.</li>
            <li>Provide Cro support for working with some common message
              queues, at least using STOMP.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <div class="card-header">
          Cro 1.0
        </div>
        <div class="card-body">
          <p>The 1.0 release will not add any notable features over 0.9,
            but rather will focus on ensuring Cro users can feel confident
            using it in production environments.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Set up a bunch of Cro services to run continually as a
              stress test, both on Rakudo releases and also on
              daily HEAD snapshots to help catch regressions early, to
              provide a better experience for Cro users. Ensure this
              information is published.</li>
            <li>Perform a security review, and provide clear
              instructions on submitting vulnerabilities along with
              documenting the process by which they will be handled.</li>
            <li>Document API stability and deprecation policy.</li>
          </ul>
